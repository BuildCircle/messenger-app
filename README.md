# Build Circle messenger using PubNub

Welcome to the Build Circle junior developer tech test. Here we will ask you to deveop a prototype instant messaging app using the PubNub messaging backend. 

The minimum deliverable is a zip file containg your source code and instructions on how to start the app. Any additional designs or documentation are also welcome. Unless instructed otherwise you will have five days to submit your app to hiring@buildcircle.co.uk. You can use any technology stack you wish, the app can either be a web app or a mobile app, we reccomend using technologies and tools you are familiar with as you will be assessed on the quality of your code as well as the apps functionality.

## Messaging Backend & PubNub
We do not expect you to build or deliver backend services for the instant messaging app. For this we will use a service called PubNub which offers comprehensive SDKs and services for creating this type of app. If you are unfamiliar with the publish & subscribe pattern used by PubNub please take some time to research it before starting the project. You will need to create a free account [here](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup), and can find the PubNub documentation [here](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/). If you have trouble creating a free account please contact chris.sewell@buildcircle.co.uk for assistence.

## Messaging Frontend
For the front end deliverable we will assess three major areas:

* Consideration of the user experience
* Quality & readability of code
* Functionality

There are a huge number of features that could be built into an instant messaging app such as emojis, gifs, read recipts and group conversations. However you only have a limited amount of time. Take as much insparation for features as you like form existing chat applications (or invent brand new ones) but not at the expense of code quality or usability. 

A submission that could rival Facebook messenger functionally but is hard to use and difficult for us to understand will score poorly. When we test your app we will run two instances of the app and try to have a conversation with them. 
For any additional user flows such as group chats, please leave us instructions on how to use them, but hopefully we won't need them.

After we have tessed the app, there will be a follow call with Chris to review.
